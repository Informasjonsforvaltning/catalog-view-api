# Catalog View API

This application provides an API for viewing your company catalog in the registration solution. Through this endpoint
you will be able to retrieve all information about resources that are registered in the registration solution of your
company. Currently, it is only possible to use this endpoint against the term catalog.

The API is protected with [Maskinporten](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/maskinporten/maskinporten/25).

For a broader understanding of the systemâ€™s context, refer to
the [architecture documentation](https://github.com/Informasjonsforvaltning/architecture-documentation) wiki. For more
specific context on this application, see the **Registration** subsystem section.
